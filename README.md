# Crestron-Module-Start-Operation
Restart Module - Crestron Series 3 and Series 4 Processors

This module works at the end of the Processor restart, setting the output to 1 for a time chosen by the "seconds" parameter.

For example: `Time = 10d = 0.1 seconds | Time = 50d = 0.5 seconds.`

This allows you to facilitate some program functions that must be performed on restart.

**This module is compiled for Crestron Series 3 and Series 4 Processors.**
